# Analyzing Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa

## Problem Statement
  Housing in any state is generally a difficult game of figuring out how to best assess value. Within every city or town, there is a plethora of information available to inform such a decision. Figuring out what features are important, which can be overlooked, and the significance of each's on a home's value is a process of sorting through this mound of information and adding context.

  Whether for students seeking opportunity at Iowa University or families putting down roots, Ames seems a fine choice.
With a 2010 population of almost 60,000 (almost half of which are college students) and an unemployment rate of just 1.5% people are moving.
Real estate agents and developers must figure out what attributes of a home make it most desirable to a potential future owner.

My goal is to filter out those features that make the most difference, in context with the city, to identify where people want to live - and why.
